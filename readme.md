# svg-clj

A simple DSL for SVG in Clojure/clojurescript.

This is currently a work in progress. Until a stable release is provided, this library is considered to be in a 'prototype' state. Breaking changes are possible until a proper release is acheived.

If you would like to understand my motivations, decisions, and reasoning for the choices I've made in this library, you can read the .org file in the top level of this repo.
